								<h4><em>Ramanujan Covering of Graphs</em></h4>
								<p>Ramanujan graphs are optimal expander graphs, and their
								existence and construction have been the focus of much research during the
								last three decades. We prove that every bipartite Ramanujan graph has a
								d-sheeted topological covering which is also Ramanujan. This generalizes
								the d=2 case, a recent major breakthrough in the subject due to Marcus,
								Spielman and Srivastava. The main tools we use are representations of
								groups and the Peter-Weyl theory, as well as the theory of interlacing
								polynomials. All notions will be explained.

								<h4><em>Orthogonal Tensor Decomposition</em></h4>
								<p>A symmetric tensor is orthogonally decomposable (or odeco) if it can be written as a linear combination of symmetric powers of n orthonormal vectors in R^n. We study the properties of odeco tensors. We give a formula for all of the eigenvectors of an odeco tensor. We also give equations which cut out the variety of odeco tensors. We develop similar theory for nonsymmetric tensors and tight frame decomposable tensors.</p>

								<h4><em>Trajectories of a Brownian Machine from Random Observations</em></h4>
								<p>A Brownian machine, a tiny device buffeted by the random motions of molecules in the environment, is capable of exploiting these thermal motions for many of the conformational changes in its work cycle. Such machines are now thought to be ubiquitous, with the ribosome, a molecular machine responsible for protein synthesis, increasingly regarded as prototypical. I describe a new analytical approach capable of determining the free-energy landscape and the continuous trajectories of molecular machines from a large number of snapshots stemming from unknown orientations and states of the machine. The approach allows model-free, quantitative analysis of the degrees of freedom and the energy landscape underlying continuous conformational changes in nanomachines, including those important for biological function.</p>

								<h4><em>Regularized and contextualized spectral clustering</em></h4>
								<p>In network data, relationships can be observed (e.g., as in a social network) or be built by some similarity function (e.g., between data points in euclidean space). To find clusters in such data, spectral clustering utilizes the eigenvectors of a similarity matrix, where the (i, j)th element measures the similarity between points i and j. Unfortunately, the standard spectral clustering algorithm often fails when the similarity matrix is sparse (a common regime). This talk will first discuss how a regularized spectral clustering algorithm can correct for the problems created by this failure. The statistical improvements from regularization are apparent in practice. The talk will theoretically characterize the improvement from regularization under the degree corrected Stochastic Blockmodel. The talk will also discuss contextualized spectral clustering in which the actors in the network have attributes that correlate with the communities in the social network. We study the misclustering rate of our proposed algorithm under a joint mixture model on the network and the node covariates; this characterizes the algorithm as a statistical estimator. Applications with a 1,000,000 node DTI neuroconnectome and a 4,000,000 node online social network motivate the analysis.</p>

								<h4><em>Minimizing quadratics over integers</em></h4>
								<p>Integer Quadratic Programming (IQP) is the problem of minimizing a quadratic polynomial over the integer points in a polyhedral region. No efficient algorithm is known to solve the general case of IQP. The lack of an efficient algorithm is not surprising, since IQP is known to be strongly NP-complete. In this seminar we survey some recent results about the complexity of IQP, and we describe exact and approximation algorithms for such problem.</p>

								<h4><em>Using Algebraic Geometry to Study Entanglement in Quantum Computers</em></h4>
								<p>Entanglement has long been one of the most puzzling aspects of quantum mechanics. Despite being poorly understood, it is generally accepted that entanglement will play a crucial role in building a quantum computer.

								To better understand the effect entanglement has on computation, physicists seek a way to determine the amount of entanglement in a quantum computer as an algorithm executes. However, in all but the simplest cases, it is difficult to determine whether or not entanglement is even present.

								In this talk we will begin by showing how quantum computers work, and explaining what entanglement is and why physicists believe it is so important. Then, we will provide a geometric description of quantum states in terms of the convex cone of positive semi-definite matrices, and show how this description allows us to approximate the set of entangled quantum data.

								This talk is aimed at graduate students from physics, math, CS and beyond. We hope that every audience member will learn something interesting from our talk.

								This project is joint with David Dynerman.</p>

								<h4><em>Automating the analysis and design of large-scale optimization algorithms</em></h4>
								<p>Most complicated optimization problems, in particular those involving a large number of variables, are solved in practice using iterative algorithms. The problem of selecting a suitable algorithm is currently more of an art than a science; a great deal of expertise is required to know which algorithms to try and how to properly tune them. Moreover, there are seldom performance guarantees. In this talk, I will show how the problem of algorithm selection can be formulated as a robust control problem. By solving simple semidefinite programs, we can derive robust bounds on convergence rates for popular algorithms such as the gradient method, proximal methods, fast/accelerated methods, and operator-splitting methods such as ADMM. The bounds derived in this manner either match or improve upon the best known bounds from the literature. Finally, our framework can be used to search for algorithms that meet desired performance specifications, thus establishing a new and principled methodology for designing new algorithms.</p>

								<h4><em>Square roots in finite fields</em></h4>
								<p>An efficient digit-by-digit method for square root extraction has been known to Westerners since Fibonacci's Liber Abaci (1202). Why is there no comparably efficient method for computing square roots in finite fields?  Since there are good randomized algorithms, this question is emblematic of a central topic in theoretical computer science: is the power of efficient computation enhanced by the ability to make random choices?  In this talk, I will explain why the square root problem for finite fields is almost (but not quite) in P, the class of problems solvable in deterministic polynomial time, and outline recent progress that has been made toward proving that it is so.</p>
