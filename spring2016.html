								  <h4><em>Linear Secret-Sharing Schemes, a brief overview</em></h4>
								  <p>11:00 AM - 12:00 PM, Friday Feb. 5, 901 Van Vleck</p>
								<p>In cryptography we call secret-sharing scheme a method for spreading information about a secret among a group of parties, such that the secret can be reconstructed only when a sufficient number of parties combine together the information they hold. The "pieces" of the secret given to the parties are called the shares of the secret. Usually we require that a small number of shares gives no information on the secret. In this talk, I will provide an overview of (linear) secret-sharing schemes: starting from their mathematical definition, I will talk about their relation with coding theory and algebraic geometry and I will conclude the talk presenting some application of linear secret-sharing schemes to cryptographic protocol design.

								  <h4><em>Chemical reaction network theory and the deficiency zero theorem</em></h4>
								  <p>11:00 AM - 12:00 PM, Thursday, Feb. 18, 901 Van Vleck</p>
								<p>Chemical reaction network theory (CRNT) is the use of dynamical systems (most often either ordinary differential equations or continuous time Markov chains) to study complex biochemical networks. CRNT assumes a class of chemical kinetics, meaning a description of rate of occurrence of the individual reactions, and seeks to describe the behavior of the network. The most common choice of kinetics gives rise to a set of polynomial ODEs describing the change in concentration of the various involved chemicals. Chemical reaction network theory draws on the theory of dynamical systems as well as techniques from algebra, algebraic geometry and graph theory. Important questions include identification and classification of biologically relevant equilibrium points, which are non-negative real solutions to polynomial systems. I will describe how a chemical network gives rise to a polynomial system and state the classical deficiency zero theorem. This theorem classifies positive real equilibrium points for networks with certain properties.

								  <h4><em>Designing the Relational Geography of a Musical System</em></h4>
								  <p>11:00 AM - 12:00 PM, Thursday Mar. 17, 901 Van Vleck</p>
								<p>
								The musical system usually referred to as “tonal” depends on a framework of pitch materials (diatonic scales, and major and minor triads, etc.) that can be generated through a well-deﬁned sequence of operations when those materials and the sources from which they’re generated are represented numerically. There is at least one model of such representation and generation that can be generalized to apply to the frameworks of many other musical systems, while not excluding that of the tonal system. In this model, the materials of the tonal system appear as a special case — one unusually regular and simple, in certain aspects. Such a model allows for powerful analogies between the well-known and well-understood musical attributes of the tonal system, and the attributes of other, more speculative, less regular, and less-well-understood musical systems.
								</p>
								<p>
								In this talk, I’ll describe the model of representation and generation of the materials of the tonal system, and then its generalization, with brief musical examples. 
								</p>
								<p>

								  <h4><em>Perturbations of Random Matrices</em></h4>
								  <p>11:00 AM - 12:00 PM, Thursday Apr. 7, 901 Van Vleck</p>
								<p>
								For many models of n by n random matrices, the distribution of eigenvalues approaches a fixed limit distribution as the size n goes to infinity.  This phenomenon follows the general idea that aggregating lots of independent sources of randomness often results in a non-random object; for example, this is one way of thinking of the central limit theorem.  This talk will explore what happens to the eigenvalue distribution when the random matrix is perturbed by adding a fixed n by n matrix.  The talk will describe a new result on perturbations that do not change the bulk eigenvalue distribution but do cause some isolated eigenvalues to appear---so called "outlier eigenvalues"---and the talk will also discuss a new result that quantifies changes in the limiting eigenvalue distribution when a random Hermitian matrix is perturbed by a non-Hermitian matrix.  The talk will include joint work with Sean O'Rourke and joint work with Alice Guionnet and Ofer Zeitouni.

								  <h4><em>Numerically computing Galois groups for applications</em></h4>
								  <p>3:30 PM - 4:30 PM, Thursday Apr. 14, B139 Van Vleck</p>
								<p>
								The Galois/monodromy group of a family of equations (or of a geometric problem) is a subtle invariant that encodes the structure of the solutions. In this talk, we will use numerical algebraic geometry to compute Galois groups. Our algorithm computes a witness set for the critical points of our family of equations. With this witness set, we use homotopy continuation to construct a generating set for the Galois group. Examples from classical algebraic geometry, kinematics, and formation shape control will be presented to illustrate the method. A background in algebraic geometry or numerical analysis will not be assumed. Joint work with Jonathan Haeunstein and Frank Sottile.

								  <h4><em>Convergence rates for non-metric multidimensional scaling</em></h4>
								  <p>11:00 PM - 12:00 PM, Thursday Apr. 21, 901 Van Vleck</p>
								<p>
									(Joint work with Lalit Jain) Suppose there are N points in a d-dimensional box and we are able to carry out queries (“triplet comparisons”) of the form “is point i closer to point j or to point k?”  The goal of non-metric MDS is to recover the locations of the N points from these queries (or some sparse subset of these queries, or these queries measured noisily, or….)  A moment’s thought makes it clear that even knowing all triplet comparisons is not enough to determine the location of the points exactly.  The right statement should be:  if you know all triplet comparisons, you can determine the location of all the points within error f(N), where f is some explicit decreasing function of N.  I’ll talk about why non-metric MDS is useful in cognitive science, why the “right statement” above is still not exactly right, some experimental results, and finally, some error bounds, whose sharpness is witnessed by theorems about sets of integers with no three in arithmetic progression.
