								<h4><em>Identifiability for Bilinear Inverse Problems with (Eventual) Applications to Blind Deconvolution, Matrix Factorization and Dictionary Finding</em></h4>
								<p>Motivated by channel estimation problems in underwater acoustic
								communications, sparse channel estimation is investigated.  For a
								particular problem relevant to cooperative communications, we see
								that our estimation problem of interest can be mapped to a bilinear
								inverse problem.  In fact, a number of important inverse problems
								in signal processing, such as blind deconvolution, matrix
								factorization, dictionary learning and blind source separation
								share the common characteristic of being bilinear inverse problems.
								In such problems, the observation model is a function of two
								variables and conditioned on one variable being known, the
								observation is a linear function of the other variable. A key
								question is that of identifiability: can one unambiguously recover
								the pair of inputs from the output? We shall consider both
								deterministic conditions for identifiability as well as
								probabilistic statements that result in new scaling laws under cone
								constraints.  Our approach is based on a unifying and flexible
								approach to identifiability that exploits a connection to low-rank
								matrix recovery.</p>

								<h4><em>Calculating All the Solutions to the Power Flow Equations</em></h4>
								<p>In this seminar we review the problem of calculating all the
								(real-valued) solutions to the &quot;power flow&quot; equations. In the field
								of power engineering, the power flow equations relate network
								voltages to power generation and demand. These nonlinear equations
								are used in some form for almost every problem in power
								engineering. For most application only a single solution is of
								interest, however for some special problems it is desired to find
								all the solutions. We present one such problem involving the
								construction of bifurcation diagrams to study the propensity for
								cascading outages in distribution networks. We review the
								literature on the number and the nature of solutions to the power
								flow equations, discuss a long-accepted algorithm for calculation
								of all the solutions, and present a counter-example to this
								algorithm. We conclude with a discussion of our on-going research
								on this topic.</p>

								<h4><em>The qKZ equation and some conjectural constant term identities, with applications to probability</em></h4>
								<p>In 1962, Freeman Dyson conjectured that the constant term in a
								certain multivariate Laurent polynomial arising in a problem in
								statistical physics is given by a multinomial coefficient. His
								conjecture was proved soon afterwards, but since then a large
								number of similar (but more complicated) &quot;constant term identities&quot;
								have been discovered. Some of them are notoriously difficult to
								prove and are related to famous problems in algebraic combinatorics
								like the enumeration of alternating sign matrices and various
								classes of plane partitions.</p>
								<p>In this talk I will describe a new class of constant term
								identities, most of them conjectural, generalizing an identity
								proved in 2007 by Di Francesco, Zinn-Justin and Zeilberger. Through
								a complicated algebraic machinery known as the quantum
								Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (qKZ) equation, I was recently able to show
								that these conjectures would imply a surprising result in
								probability, namely that the probability of so-called &quot;connectivity
								events&quot; in a certain percolation model are all rational numbers
								computable by an explicit algorithm. (The probabilistic aspect of
								the results will be described more in detail in my probability
								seminar talk the previous day.)</p>

								<h4><em>Identifiability of Linear Compartment Models</em></h4>
								<p>Identifiability concerns finding which unknown parameters of a
								model can be quantified from given input-output data. Many linear
								ODE models, used primarily in Systems Biology, are unidentifiable,
								which means that parameters can take on an infinite number of
								values and yet yield the same input-output data. We study a
								particular class of unidentifiable models and find conditions to
								obtain identifiable reparameterizations of these models. In
								particular, we use a graph-theoretic approach to analyze the models
								and show that graphs with certain properties allow a monomial
								scaling reparameterization over identifiable functions of the
								parameters.  We also examine conditions to obtain local
								identifiability for this class of models, and in particular, show
								how identifiability can by determined by simply looking at the
								graphical structure of these linear compartment models.</p>

								<h4><em>Siegel&#8217;s theorem, edge coloring, and a Holant dichotomy</em></h4>
								<p>What do Siegel&#8217;s theorem on finiteness of integer solutions have to
								do with complexity theory?  In this talk, we discuss a new
								complexity dichotomy theorem for counting problems.  Such a
								dichotomy is a classification of a class of problems into exactly
								two kinds: those that are computable in polynomial time, and those
								that are #P-hard, and thus intractable.  An example problem in this
								dichotomy is the problem of counting the number of edge colorings
								of a graph.  We will show that an effective version of Siegel&#8217;s
								theorem and some Galois theory are key ingredients in the proof of
								this dichotomy. Along the way we will also meet the Tutte
								polynomial, medial graphs, Eulerian partitions, Puiseux series, and
								a certain lattice condition on the (logarithms of) the roots of
								polynomials with integer coefficients. This is joint work with
								Jin-Yi Cai and Heng Guo.</p>

								<h4><em>Vectorial Phase Retrieval for 1-D signals and 2-D images</em></h4>
								<p>Phase retrieval - namely the recovery of a signal from its absolute
								Fourier transform is a problem of fundamental importance in many
								fields. In 1-D Phase retrieval is ill-posed, admitting multiple
								solutions. In 2-D it often admits a unique solution, but finding it
								is challenging. Current iterative algorithms are computationally
								intensive and most have no theoretical guarantees on the properties
								of their obtained solution.</p>
								<p>In this talk I&#8217;ll present a novel framework, denoted vectorial
								phase retrieval. The key underlying idea is that in many physical
								scenarios one can measure not only one signal, but also another
								independent one, and their interference.</p>
								<p>From a mathematical perspective, We show that this novel framework
								leads to uniqueness already in the 1-D case. We next derive
								computationally efficient and robust to noise algorithms for
								recovery of the phases under several 1-D and 2-D settings of
								practical physical interest.</p>
								<p>We illustrate the reconstruction performance of our algorithms both
								with simulated signals, as well as on actual experimental 2-d
								data. We conclude with several yet unresolved challenges -
								mathematical, statistical and computational.</p>
